`Tailor` uses your project's own source code to help you inject details about
them into existing documentation. It does this by leveraging 
TypeScript's AST parser and JSDoc annotations to derive information such as
names, descriptions, types, and much more. You can target precise sections of
your documentation by using `Tailor`'s custom templating system ...

information that will never all out-of-sync with its source

`Tailor` uses a custom templating engine to inject dynamic information derived
from your project's source files into a target file.

Include details about your project where you want them, how you want them, and ...

Effortlessly include details about your project anywhere you want them, that
will always stay in sync 

This allows you to effortlessly
include information about your software directly from the source. 

With the use of an AST compiler and JSDoc annotated 
... with information derived from an AST compiler and JSDoc annotations.

Auto-generated JSDoc sites are easy to generate, but they offer generic designs and limited
customizability. On the other hand, handcrafted documentation offers limitless customization but
is cumbersome and often requires duplication. `Tailor` was created in an attempt to sieze the
benefits of both approaches.

- Source files supported: '.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx', '.mjs', '.cjs'
- Target files supported: '.md', 'html', 'xml', '.mdx'
